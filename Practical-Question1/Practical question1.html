1. Create a GitHub Repository
Log in to your GitHub account
Click the + icon in the top-right corner and select New repository.
Give your repository a name e.g Feumatio-neih-kate-laura

3. Clone the Specific Branch
	To bring the repository to your computer and start working specifically on that new branch:
Click the green <> Code button and copy the HTTPS URL.
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
git clone -b feature-branch https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
4. Push Changes to the Branch
	Once you have made changes to your files locally, follow these steps to send them back to GitHub:
git add .
Commit your changes:
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
git push origin feature-branch
5. Pull From a Branch
If someone else (or you, from another computer) has updated the branch on GitHub, you need to sync your local files:
Ensure you are on the correct branch:
git checkout feature-branch
Pull the updates:
git pull origin feature-branch
